# Pomodoro CLI üçÖ </>

[About Pomodoro Technique](https://www.pomodorotechnique.com/)

This repository contains a command-line application that implements the Pomodoro Technique. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method. It uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

This application allows users to set the duration of focus and rest periods according to their preferences. It plays an alarm sound to signal the end of each focus and rest period.

This project is open-source, and contributions are welcome to enhance its functionality and usability.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Fabian-Orozco/pomodoro_cli.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the directory:
    ```
    cd pomodoro_cli
    ```

3. Install the required library:
    ```
    pip install playsound
    ```

4. Run the application:
    ```
    python pomodoro.py
    ```

5. Follow the prompts to enter the number of minutes for focus and rest periods.

6. The application will start the Pomodoro sessions, playing an alarm sound at the end of each focus and rest period (25 and 5 minutes recommended respectively). Press any button to stop the alarm and proceed to the next session. To exit the application, press 'q' when prompted to stop the alarm.
